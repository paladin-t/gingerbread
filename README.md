Dear friend,

I'm a nobody who loves the world as you do. Just wanna gift you with some [gingerbread](https://tonywang.itch.io/gingerbread) cookies I've baked. Merry Christmas and happy new year, I wish you good luck with your endeavour in the new year! Spread the cookies to your friends if you like it, follow me for my future creations.

Sincerely,

Tony
